## Overview

### The challenge

Required (by TOP) features: 
Create three buttons, one for each selection (with an event listener) for the user
Add computer play function that randomly return either Rock, Paper or Scissors
Play 5 rounds
Display the running score and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points

Unrequited features:
An introduction with a typewriter effect
Option to refuse playing (to which the computer must react) 
Restart screen, on which there is the winner announcement + different texts and images, depending on who won + restart button that starts the game from the choice between Rock, Paper and Scissors (no intro given again).
Blinking effect for the buttons (constant blink in some cases, in others after hover)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

How to set up a new branch (and how to merge it with the main one)
How to manipulate DOM
How to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another and how to define the animation sequence using keyframes
How to create a Typewriter effect in JS
How to randomly select items out of an array

### Continued development

The code does exactly what I wanted it to, but there is still a lot to improve in terms of writing it *clean*, so I will work more on that.
